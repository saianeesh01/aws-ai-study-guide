  {
    question: "What is Machine Learning?",
    answer: "A type of AI where systems learn from data to make predictions without being explicitly programmed."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the three main types of ML?",
    answer: "Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning."
  },
  {
    question: "What is overfitting?",
    answer: "When a model memorizes training data and performs poorly on new/unseen data."
  },
  {
    question: "What is underfitting?",
    answer: "When a model is too simple to capture meaningful patterns in the data."
  },
  {
    question: "What is inference?",
    answer: "Using a trained model to make predictions on new data."
  },
  {
    question: "What is labeled data?",
    answer: "Data that includes both input and the correct output â€” used in supervised learning."
  },
  {
    question: "What is unlabeled data?",
    answer: "Data that includes only input with no known output â€” used in unsupervised learning."
  },
  {
    question: "Which ML type is used for classification tasks?",
    answer: "Supervised Learning."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of problems is unsupervised learning best for?",
    answer: "Finding hidden patterns or groupings like customer segmentation."
  },
  {
    question: "Which ML type learns through rewards and penalties?",
    answer: "Reinforcement Learning."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a model in machine learning?",
    answer: "An algorithm that learns patterns from data to make predictions."
  },
  {
    question: "What is training data used for?",
    answer: "To teach the model how to understand patterns in the data."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between training and inference?",
    answer: "Training builds the model, inference uses the model to predict."
  },
  {
    question: "What does high variance in a model indicate?",
    answer: "The model may be overfitting and too sensitive to training data."
  },
  {
    question: "What does high bias in a model indicate?",
    answer: "The model may be underfitting and too simple."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a target variable?",
    answer: "The output the model is trying to predict in supervised learning."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a feature in machine learning?",
    answer: "An individual measurable property or input used by the model."
  },
  {
    question: "What is model evaluation?",
    answer: "The process of testing how well your model performs on unseen data."
  },
  {
    question: "What does a confusion matrix show?",
    answer: "The performance of a classification model with actual vs predicted values."
  },
  {
    question: "Name one use case for reinforcement learning.",
    answer: "Game-playing AI like AlphaGo or self-driving cars."
  },
  {
    question: "What is one risk of using too many features?",
    answer: "It can lead to overfitting and poor performance on new data."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a real-world example of supervised learning?",
    answer: "Email spam detection based on past labeled emails."
  },
  {
    question: "What is an example of unsupervised learning?",
    answer: "Grouping customers into segments without predefined labels."
  },
  {
    question: "How is reinforcement learning different from the other types?",
    answer: "It learns through actions and feedback instead of data labels."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a predictive model?",
    answer: "A model trained to make future predictions based on past data."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is data quality important in ML?",
    answer: "Poor data leads to inaccurate models and wrong predictions."
  }
