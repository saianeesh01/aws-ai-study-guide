    { question: "What is IAM in AWS?", answer: "Identity and Access Management â€” controls access to AWS services and resources." },
    { question: "What are IAM roles used for in AI applications?", answer: "Grant temporary permissions to services like SageMaker, Lambda, etc." },
    { question: "How does AWS KMS help secure ML models?", answer: "Encrypts data and models using customer-managed keys." },
    { question: "What is VPC used for in ML pipelines?", answer: "Isolates services and adds network-level security for SageMaker endpoints." },
    { question: "What does SageMaker Model Monitor do?", answer: "Monitors data drift and model performance in production." },

    { question: "What is data leakage in ML?", answer: "When future data unintentionally influences the training process." },
    { question: "What is an endpoint in SageMaker?", answer: "A real-time API for serving ML model predictions." },
    { question: "What is the benefit of decoupling ML services?", answer: "Improves scalability, modularity, and debugging." },
    { question: "How can IAM policies enforce least privilege?", answer: "By granting only the exact permissions needed per user or service." },
    { question: "What AWS service provides security event insights?", answer: "Amazon GuardDuty." },
    { question: "What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?", answer: "A security mechanism requiring a second authentication factor beyond username/password." },
