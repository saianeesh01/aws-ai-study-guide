    { question: "What are real-world uses of RNNs?", answer: "Speech recognition, language translation, sentiment analysis." },
    { question: "What is transfer learning?", answer: "Using a pre-trained model on a new, related problem to speed up training." },
    { question: "What is model inference?", answer: "Using a trained model to make predictions on new data." },
    { question: "What is fine-tuning?", answer: "Adjusting a pre-trained modelâ€™s weights to adapt to a specific task." },
