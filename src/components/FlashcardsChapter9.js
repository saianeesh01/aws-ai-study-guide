    { question: "What is Amazon Forecast?", answer: "A managed ML service that generates accurate time series forecasts." },
    { question: "What type of data does Forecast use?", answer: "Time-series data (with timestamps and values)." },
    { question: "Does Forecast require ML expertise?", answer: "No, it supports AutoML for easy use." },
    { question: "What are quantiles in Forecast?", answer: "Percentile-based predictions like P10, P50, and P90 for uncertainty estimates." },
    { question: "What is a Predictor in Amazon Forecast?", answer: "A trained model that can generate forecasts." },
    { question: "What are the 3 types of datasets Forecast can use?", answer: "Target Time Series, Related Time Series, and Item Metadata." },
    { question: "What is the minimum required dataset type?", answer: "Target Time Series." },
    { question: "Can you use external features in Forecast?", answer: "Yes, with Related Time Series." },
    { question: "What format must input files be in?", answer: "CSV with a specific schema and timestamp format." },
    { question: "What is a Forecast Horizon?", answer: "How far into the future predictions are made (e.g., 30 days)." },
    { question: "How is accuracy measured?", answer: "With metrics like WQL, RMSE, and MAPE." },
    { question: "What does AutoML do in Forecast?", answer: "Automatically selects the best algorithm and hyperparameters." },
    { question: "Can Forecast integrate with Lambda?", answer: "Yes, to automate updates or responses." },

    { question: "Use of Forecast in healthcare?", answer: "To predict patient flow and staffing needs." },
    { question: "Use of Forecast in finance?", answer: "Revenue prediction, cost planning, and cash flow forecasting." },
    { question: "Can Forecast be triggered by an event?", answer: "Yes, using EventBridge, Lambda, or Step Functions." },
    { question: "What is P90 in forecasting?", answer: "A conservative forecast â€” 90% of predicted values fall below this." },
    { question: "What kind of model evaluation is done?", answer: "Forecast automatically calculates metrics like WQL." },
    { question: "What is the Forecast ARN?", answer: "Amazon Resource Name that uniquely identifies the Forecast entity." },
    { question: "Can you export forecasted values?", answer: "Yes, to Amazon S3 for downstream use." },
    { question: "Is Forecast integrated with SageMaker?", answer: "Not directly â€” it's standalone but can work with SageMaker output." }
