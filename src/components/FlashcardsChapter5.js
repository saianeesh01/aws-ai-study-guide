    {
      question: "What is model training in machine learning?",
      answer: "The process of teaching a model to recognize patterns in data by adjusting its parameters using training data."
    },
    {
      question: "What is model evaluation?",
      answer: "Measuring a modelâ€™s performance on unseen data using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of training data?",
      answer: "To allow the model to learn patterns and relationships between input features and labels."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of a validation set?",
      answer: "To fine-tune the model and select the best hyperparameters before final testing."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the test set used for?",
      answer: "To evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data."
    },
    {
      question: "What is overfitting?",
      answer: "When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data because it memorized instead of generalized."
    },
    {
      question: "What is underfitting?",
      answer: "When a model is too simple to learn the patterns in the training data."
    },
    {
      question: "What is accuracy?",
      answer: "The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made."
    },
    {
      question: "What is precision?",
      answer: "The proportion of true positives among all predicted positives."
    },
    {
      question: "What is recall?",
      answer: "The proportion of true positives identified among all actual positives."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the F1 score?",
      answer: "The harmonic mean of precision and recall. Useful for imbalanced datasets."
    },
    {
      question: "What is RMSE?",
      answer: "Root Mean Square Error â€” a regression metric that measures prediction error magnitude."
    },
    {
      question: "What is gradient descent?",
      answer: "An optimization algorithm that updates model weights to minimize the loss function."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a loss function?",
      answer: "A function that measures how far predictions are from actual labels."
    },
    {
      question: "What is early stopping?",
      answer: "Stopping training when validation performance stops improving to prevent overfitting."
    },
    {
      question: "What is cross-validation?",
      answer: "A technique to evaluate models by splitting data into multiple train/test sets."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a confusion matrix?",
      answer: "A table showing true/false positives and negatives to assess classification performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Why use multiple metrics for evaluation?",
      answer: "One metric may not reflect all aspects of performance, especially in imbalanced data."
    },
    {
      question: "What is batch training?",
      answer: "Training the model using all data in batches instead of one data point at a time."
    },
    {
      question: "What is an epoch?",
      answer: "One complete pass through the training dataset during training."
    },
    {
      question: "What is learning rate?",
      answer: "A hyperparameter that determines the step size in gradient descent."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if learning rate is too high?",
      answer: "The model may oscillate or diverge instead of converging to a solution."
    },
    {
      question: "What is model bias?",
      answer: "Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm."
    },
    {
      question: "What is model variance?",
      answer: "Error due to sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data."
    },
    {
      question: "What does regularization do?",
      answer: "Penalizes large weights to reduce overfitting and improve generalization."
    },
    {
      question: "What is L1 regularization?",
      answer: "Adds the absolute value of weights to the loss function (Lasso)."
    },
    {
      question: "What is L2 regularization?",
      answer: "Adds the squared value of weights to the loss function (Ridge)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why split data into train/val/test?",
      answer: "To ensure the model learns, tunes, and generalizes properly."
    },
    {
      question: "What is model generalization?",
      answer: "The ability of a model to perform well on new, unseen data."
    },
    {
      question: "What is hyperparameter tuning?",
      answer: "Searching for the best values for settings like learning rate, batch size, etc."
